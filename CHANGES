v3.1 (November 2003)	PUBLIC RELEASE
	(sdel-mod)	I added a kernel module in v3.0 which wipes all
			files which are unlinked() in the kernel. However
			it didnt work, so it was not official.
			However, deathcubek@md2600.net sent in a patch,
			so now it is working :-)
			After "make install" do "insmod sdel-mod"
	(srm)		Fixed a bug which prevented to delete directories

v3.0 (April 2003)	PUBLIC RELEASE
	(all)		Added >2GB file support
	(all)		rewrote all tools to use a central library, this
			was long time necessary!
	(all)		warning now displayed if ulimit value resetting
			support was not compiled in.
	(sswap)		added -j(ump) option to skip over a defined number
			of bytes of the block device.
	(srm)		skipping file wipe if it is hardlinked!
	(fileutils-rm)	Update the rm.diff for the newest fileutil (4.1)
	(all)		updated the link for our homepage + email to thc.org

v2.5 (May 2001)		PUBLIC RELEASE
	(all)		updated the link for our homepage to
			www.thehackerschoice.com

v2.4 (October 2000)	PRIVATE RELEASE
	(all)		added the option -z to write zeros as last wipe
			instead of random data
	(sfill)		added the options -i and -I to not or exclusivly wipe
                        inode space and expanded the number of inodes to wipe
	(the_cleaner.sh) added a new shellscript called the_cleaner.sh which
			wipes temporary directories, all user's history and
			netscape history/cache files, free disk and inode
			space, swap space and the memory. Easy shellscript
			to place in the shutdown phase of runlevel 2 and 3!
	(all)		beautified the help output; updated documentation
	(all)		added srm/sfill/sswap/smem as linux elf binaries

v2.3 (August 2000)	PUBLIC RELEASE
	(sfill)		now also wipes all inodes in the directory specified
	(srm)		fixed a bug in srm when deleting dirs without -r option
			(thanks to typo/teso)

v2.2 (October 1999)	PUBLIC RELEASE
	(WWW)		ugh, the redirector service base.org is down!
			WWW site: http://www.infowar.co.uk/thc
	(all)		code cleanup to prevent warnings (thanks Rebecca!)
			(some weird systems need O_FSYNC and strings.h)
	(srm)		the blocksize used for wiping is now enlarged if the
			filesystem is detected to use bigger blocks.
	(srm/sfill/sswap) changed the behaviour, now the last wipe is always
			a random one, so it's harder to find out that a
			secure deletion was done. (Thanks to Dan Farmer for
			this idea)
	(srm)		the random buffer to write was not renewed after one
			write to the file, this makes it pretty fast but also
			not that secure. No all random writes are unique. The
			other tools had that from the beginning on. duh

v2.1 (April 1999)	PRIVATE RELEASE
	(all)		added the -f(ast) option.
	(smem)		added a new tool: smem, which wipes free memory
	(srm/sfill/smem) added rlimit resets
	(sfill/sswap)	quadroupled the buffer size
	(srm/sfill/sswap) fix for openbsd which doesn't know O_SYNC open(2).
        (srm)		added the -d(ot) option. Ignores "." and ".." on the
			commandline
	(srm)		fixed directory and file link races.
			Thanks to Solar Designer bringing this to my attention.
			Note that there is a small racecondition left which
			can be exploited from an attacker to chmod 0600 a file
			to it's owner if the owner is running srm and the
			attacker has write access to the target directory.
			The other wipe programs have this problem too - and
			( - wiping anything in your tree for which you
			have write permission ... - ) worse.

v2.0
	(all)		added man pages for srm, sfill and sswap!
	(all)		increased speed by ~300% by writing big buffers.
	(all)		using /dev/urandom for random passes now if available
			(this is more secure, however costs speed)
	(all)		added the O_SYNC bit to all open calls. Should not
			add security, but who knows how weired systems behave.
	(all)		the -s option(s) is now ignored. The standard mode
			is now the secure mode. Use -l to lessen the security.
	(srm)		added the option -r for directory recursion
	(srm)		doing a chmod() now before opening the file
	(srm)		fixed handling of symlink and special files
	(rm.diff)	includes all the above except for the new -s/-l change
	(all)		cosmetics + documenation updates

v1.8
	(rm.diff)	updated the diff and did some more security and speed.
	(all)		a bit cosmetics

v1.7
	(srm)		using fsync() now, which gives you 10-25% speed !
	(all)		using perror() for better error reporting
	(srm/sfill)	included file truncating before unlinking (security!)

v1.6
	[www distrib.]	http://r3wt.base.org - check out the THC area
	[email]		my new email: vh@reptile.rug.ac.be
	(sswap)		added a new tool: a secure swap cleaner. remember to
			unmount your swap first. *only tested on linux* !
	(srm/sfill) 	added trapping signals and exiting clean on them
	(srm/sfill)	errors are sent do stderr now instead to stdout
	(srm/sfill)	general code cleanup
	(sfill)		fixed race condition to prevent symlink attacks
	(sfill)		warning if executed by user!=root, because not all
			free space can be overwritten (idea by fyodor@dhp.com)
	(rm.diff)	replaces the rm.c replacement with a diff (+ bugfix)
	(sdel.exe/sfill.exe) removed the msdos versions. They 1st already
			included the features above and 2nd are no longer
			supported (at least by me - get a good unix)

v1.4
	(sfill)		some flushing on stdout done
	(sfill)		more error checking
	(srm/sfill)	cosmetics

v1.3
			initial public release.
