# secure_delete
Upload of THC.org's secure_delete package. This package used to be availble on
THC.org. It was originally written by Van Hausen. VH has created a github, but
so far has not uploaded this package. This package, is somewhat critical as
other packages like nautilus-wipe depend upon it, so I have uploaded it to
github.

I cannot take credit for this, but I am doing this to keep this publicly
available. All attempts to contact VH have failed.
