# secure_delete
Fork of Van Hauser of THC's secure-delete package.

Note on package tags. 3.1 is the original last release from VH. This is entirely
unmolested from upstream. letter tags will be sequential.

Re-released under same GPLv2 as the original.

There are no new features planned, and it will work exactly as the original,
only with maintenance done, and patches added from upstream to keep
compatibility with modern systems long after it has been written
